# AL Language Evolution: Techniques for Modern Developers #
Whether you're a fresh face in the development world or a dinosaur from the C/AL days, the AL Language has undergone significant advancements that can enhance your code quality, readability, and performance. This session offers valuable insights and practical techniques for all levels of experience. Just like archeologists uncovering ancient artifacts, weâ€™ll dig deep into the AL Language to unearth hidden gems and forgotten treasures. We will cover coding topics that may not be commonly used because of their limited use cases, and we may even try to teach our cherished dinosaurs a few new tricks.

Some example topics: lists and dictionaries, system application libraries, RichTextContent, error handling and more!
